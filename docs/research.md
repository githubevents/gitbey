# GitBey Research Summary

## Idea Overview

GitBey is a mobile app that takes a user's GitHub handle, analyzes the vibe of their last 50 commits, and recommends 5 Beyoncé songs accordingly. Users can play the songs within the app.

## Customers

- Software developers and engineers who use GitHub
- Fans of Beyoncé and pop music
- Tech-savvy music lovers
- People interested in novelty or entertainment apps that blend productivity and pop culture

## Problem Statements

- Developers often seek fun, personalized ways to reflect on their coding activity
- There is a lack of apps that combine code analysis with music recommendations
- Music can help improve mood and productivity, but current music apps do not personalize based on coding activity

## Possible Competitors

- Spotify Wrapped (personalized music stats, but not code-based)
- GitHub Skyline (visualizes commits, but no music integration)
- Mood-based music apps (e.g., Moodagent, but not tied to coding)
- No direct competitor that combines GitHub commit analysis with music recommendations

## Unmet Needs

- Personalized music recommendations based on developer activity
- Fun, shareable insights that blend coding and pop culture
- In-app music playback tied to unique, data-driven experiences

## Differentiators

- Unique combination of GitHub data analysis and Beyoncé music
- Novelty factor: appeals to both developers and Beyoncé fans
- Shareable results (potential for social media virality)
- Potential for expansion to other artists or music genres

## Marketing

- Target developer communities (GitHub, Stack Overflow, Reddit)
- Collaborate with Beyoncé fan groups and music forums
- Leverage social media for shareable results (e.g., "My GitBey Vibe")
- Influencer partnerships in tech and music spaces

## Business Models

- Freemium: free basic use, paid premium features (e.g., more song options, deeper analysis)
- Affiliate links to music streaming services
- Sponsored content or partnerships with music labels
- In-app ads (if user base is large enough)

## Next Steps

- Validate interest with target users
- Explore technical feasibility (GitHub API, music streaming integration)
- Prototype core features and test user experience
