# Implementation Plan: GitBey App

## Overview

This plan outlines the step-by-step implementation for the GitBey mobile app, which analyzes a user's GitHub commit history and generates personalized Beyoncé playlists based on coding mood.

## Step 1: GitHub API Integration

**Objective:** Fetch a user's recent commit history from GitHub.

- Add HTTP and dotenv dependencies.
- Create a GitHub service class to fetch public events for a username.
- Use a GitHub token for authenticated requests.
- Parse and return commit data (limit to 50 most recent commits).
- Handle errors (network, invalid username, rate limits).
- UI: Input for username, button to fetch, display commit count and sample message.
- **User intervention:** Provide a valid GitHub token in `.env`.

## Step 2: Sentiment Analysis of Commits

**Objective:** Analyze commit messages to determine coding mood.

- Add a sentiment analysis package or implement a simple algorithm.
- Preprocess commit messages (lowercase, remove punctuation, etc.).
- For each commit, compute a sentiment score (positive/negative/neutral).
- Aggregate scores to determine overall mood (e.g., happy, frustrated, productive).
- UI: Display mood summary and example analysis.
- **User intervention:** None required.

## Step 3: AI Playlist Generation

**Objective:** Generate Beyoncé song recommendations based on commit sentiment.

- Integrate with an AI model (e.g., OpenAI, GitHub Models API) for song selection.
- Design prompt templates for the AI (provide mood and context).
- Send request to AI API and parse response (list of 5 songs).
- UI: Display recommended songs with mood context.
- **User intervention:** Provide AI API key in `.env` if required.

## Step 4: Audio Integration (Optional)

**Objective:** Enable song playback within the app.

- Integrate with a music API (e.g., Spotify) for audio previews.
- Set up developer credentials for the music API.
- Implement audio playback UI (play, pause, etc.).
- UI: Show song list with play buttons.
- **User intervention:** Register for music API credentials and add to `.env`.

---

## Step 5: Testing & Debugging

**Objective:** Ensure all features work as expected.

- Write and run unit/widget tests for each feature.
- Test on iOS and Android simulators.
- Debug and fix issues as needed.
- **User intervention:** Run tests and report bugs.

---

## Step 6: Polish & Documentation

**Objective:** Finalize app for release.

- Refine UI/UX for a beautiful, modern look.
- Add documentation and usage instructions.
- Prepare for App Store/Play Store submission.
- **User intervention:** Review and approve final app.
